            <h3>Sensors and Simulations</h3>
            <p>I have great experiance in Simulation systems like MATLAB and PSPICE focusing on simulations of electronic systems such as circuits and networks.</p>

            <h3>Embedded Systems</h3>
            <p>Also along with simulation tech I also have experience in Embedded systems
               such as ESP32 a widely used chipset which is deployed in many feilds including IOT and Server systems.

             I have done many projects which involves lates embedded and network technologies such as LEACH which I used in one of my projects to optime the clustering of the sensors in a grid.
             
               Also On my other project I have made use of technologies such as AAC and PARCOR in which I tried to produce an audio with near to zero loss.
              
               <b>In my latest project</b> I have hybridized different techniques in a digital logic circuit to optimize its power on 16-nanometer scale.
